"""arms: eighteen capability switches, all default OFF, and nothing computed the sum.

Every arm in this codebase is `bool(os.environ.get("TETHER_X"))` -- no default value, so OFF
unless the environment says otherwise -- and **nothing in the repository sets one**. The agent
that actually runs is therefore the most starved variant of itself, in eighteen independent
respects, and that was true without anyone deciding it.

**THE FINDING IS NOT THAT THEY ARE WRONGLY OFF.** Each site carries a real reason and several
are costed: `TETHER_INSTRUMENTS` is off because a new published attribute widens the slot set
and §12.12 prices that in EPISODES FORGONE; `TETHER_SHAPE_DELTA` says *both arms belong on
together; that is a measurement, not a default*. Turning any of them on is a measurement and
a ruling, and this seat does neither.

**THE FINDING IS THAT THE REASONS LIVE AT NINETEEN SCATTERED SITES AND NO PLACE HELD THE SUM.**
That is verbatim the ground-focus seat's own origin -- *each looked reasonable alone; the drift
was visible only in the sum, and nothing computed the sum* -- one level up, about configuration
instead of commits. **Eighteen individually-justified OFFs compose into an agent nobody chose.**

    python arms.py        the census, and it FAILS on the three things below

WHAT MAKES IT FAIL, and each is a fact rather than a judgement:

    UNDECLARED   an arm is read in code and absent from the table below. **A new arm cannot
                 enter silently**, which is how eighteen accumulated
    STALE        the table names an arm no code reads any more
    HALF A PAIR  an arm is ON and a partner its own site declares is OFF. `arc_percept` says
                 of the shape deltas: *the `holes` and `perimeter` ATOMS only resolve when
                 `TETHER_SHAPE_DECODE` is on, so with arm I off the agent reads a delta of a
                 quantity it cannot itself measure.* **That coupling was written in a comment
                 and nothing enforced it**

IT DECIDES NOTHING AND FLIPS NOTHING. The table is DATA -- `conform/lint.py`'s rule, *exemptions
as data, not logic* -- so it can be read, pinned and moved by the reviewer without touching code.
